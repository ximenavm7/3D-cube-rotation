# 3DWireframe
3D Wireframe using C# and GDI+.   Based on a VB.NET project by leonelmachava (http://codentronix.com)

I had been looking for some time to find simple, easy to read code that demonstrates basic 3D maths, and I found it - in VB.NET.
I translated the code for those that want to learn 3D with C#.

Please - don't expect updates. This is very basic so that people can learn from it. I don't want to make this complex.
